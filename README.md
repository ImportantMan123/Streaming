## Purpose of project

I created the Streaming project in to order to test my exiting knowledge of JavaScript. If I were to improve this project I'd add the following:
* Use a framework to make the project responsive
* Ability to add own songs to the platform
* Add funtionality to select other albums 
* Add a search function
* Use a database to store the music
